    questions:

      - question: What was your favourite island and why?
        answer: >
          <p>This question for me naturally became an El Nido-versus-Coron argument, both of which are situated in Palawan, voted best island in the world by Conde Naste Traveller.</p>
          <p>If I had to choose between the two, it would go with Coron. This paradise is absolutely jaw dropping. While the island is blessed with perfect white beaches, what distinguishes it from El Nido is Coron’s charming lakes. The popular Kayangan lake couldn’t be more picturesque from a vantage point accessible through a 15-minute steep hike up. If you are into scuba diving, then Coron will surely give you a unique experience diving through WW2 Japanese shipwrecks, inhabited by a rich marine life of colourful corals and thick schools of fishes around—it’s amazing to see! I also found Coron less crowded than El Nido, if you’re after a bit of serenity.</p>

      - question: Did you discover any hidden gems that people should know about?
        answer: >
          <p class="p--bold title">Sagada, Philippines</h4>
          <p>There are a lot! Sagada, Mountain Province was such a precious visit. It is famous for its beautiful caves, hanging coffins, as well as the serene mountains. What surprised me though is its cool, trendy and artsy cafes which you wouldn’t expect given how native or natural the place is.</p>
          <h4 class="p--bold title">Pinatubo Volcano</h4>
          <p>The second strongest volcanic eruption in history has formed a breathtaking crater lake. Before you get to see this gem, you need to get on a mandatory 4x4 drive to the jump-off point. This is followed by a two-hour trek which involves traversing through canyons created by the ash that fell from Mt Pinatubo, and crossing streams of cold ragging water.</p>
          <h4 class="p--bold title">Kawasan falls</h4>
          <p>Get on an adrenaline pumping action in Cebu's hidden canyons.  To get to the crystal waters of Kawasan Falls, you are expected to ‘canyoneer’ for 2.5 hours, which includes 5+ thrilling cliff jumps and a couple of natural slides!</p>

      - question: What do you think makes the Philippines unique?
        answer: >
          <p>When people claim their country hosts the most welcoming people in the world, it is always a bit of a cliché. In the case of the Philippines, it is actually true! Filipinos are rightly proud of their country and love showing visitors everything it has to offer. Be it their traditions, cuisine, or way of living, the locals will always encourage you in indulging in their culture and make you feel at home. There are many beautiful countries in the world, but few that also have such wonderful people.</p>
          <p>Imagine a country made up of more than 7 100 islands, the amount of paradise-like beaches and the variety of things you can do are beyond your imagination. Because of this, the popular national tourism slogan “it’s more fun in the Philippines” couldn’t be truer – you will not run out of fun things to do in this country.</p>
          <p>If you think of Asia, you immediately associate it with temples, Buddhism and in between. What makes Philippines unique was the fact that it was under the Spanish rule for over 300 years. This history lives on in the architecture, cuisine, religion and norms.</p>
