An underrated playground of burgeoning urban cool.

  class: abandoned-theme-park
  location: Manila
  guide-class: luzon
  guide-section-class: central-luzon
  content: A rather curious artefact high in the hills outside Manila makes for quirky photography and truly surreal sights. Often lauded to have been a Disneyland rival – a fact hard to imagine – this theme park was abandoned as the Japanese investor went bankrupt. Now, faux-medieval castles hawk over the countryside, whilst forgotten rides remain still in an eerie, borderline dystopian image.

  class: taal-volcano-and-lake-hike
  location:
  guide-class: luzon
  guide-section-class: central-luzon
  content: Set within a vast lake is the peak of this mesmerising volcano. Well, many peaks and many craters, centring around ominous Taal – one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world. Take a banca to the crater’s edge, and hike to the sulfurous lake that occupies the centre – the scene is beautiful, were it not for the impending danger that the crater poses.

  location:
  guide-class: luzon

  location:
  guide-class: luzon

The shelved, stepped hills are a true wonder, now protected by UNESCO.

- title: Hanging Coffins of Sagada
  class: hanging-coffins-of-sagada
  location:
  guide-class: luzon
  guide-section-class: north-luzon
  content: Deep in the Mountain Province lies this particularly eerie sight. The pre-colonial community has a burial tradition, whereby they nail coffins to the side of a cliff following days of vigil with the deceased.
