##  OTHER HIGHLIGHTS
##  =========================

- title: Batanes
  class: batanes
  content: These isolated islands are a perfect antidote to city life. As the northernmost islands in the country, you’ll find a sparse and curious collection of coffee huts, souvenir shops and restaurants. A tiny population facilitates this, but the main draw is the nature – untouched, pristine and luscious scenes await.

- title: Chocolate Hills
  class: chocolate-hills
  location: Bohol
  content: A marvellous natural oddity, the chocolate-drop hills ripple and roll over the valley. An iconic Filipino treat, they are best explored with a quad bike, which will allow you to cover plenty ground and unpick tiny villages that dot the valley.
