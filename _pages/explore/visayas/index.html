  - title: Panay
    class: panay
    content: >
      <p class="p--lead">Exploring Panay is all about taking the route less travelled.</p>
      <p>This sizeable island has been woefully ignored by travellers using it as a stop-off for heading to Boracay – the tiny party island that is as stunning as it is now expensive. So head further inland and explore the diversity of Panay, awash with tropical haunts, endless beaches, colonial towns and cities, and awesome natural scenes. </p>

  - title: Boracay
    class: boracay
    content: >
      <p class="p--lead">This tiny spit of land above Panay has been a much-hyped island paradise, having come second in the draw of best island paradise in the world by Travel + Leisure readers, losing out to Palawan. </p>
      <p>That’s right, top two were both in the Philippines! The 4km stretch of White Beach is a dreamy idyll that constitutes the finest elements of the country – shallow turquoise waters, powder-white sands, banca boats gliding across the calm seas and endless shady palm trees. There’s a reason it’s such a massive tourist draw – astounding beauty lies at every glance. </p>

  - title: Cebu
    class: cebu
    content: >
      <p class="p--lead">Head over to Cebu, the heart of the Visayas island group.</p>
      <p>Buzzing Cebu City is a riotous stomping ground of delectable food, electric bars and high-rise modernity, whereas the rest of the island offers peaceful retreats of typical Filipino splendour. Known for great diving spots and enigmatic natural features, making Cebu a great island destination.</p>

  - title: Bohol
    class: bohol
    content: >
      <p class="p--lead">Most pictures of Bohol are framed by the wide-eyed Tarsiers and the compelling rolling of the Chocolate Hills, yet Bohol offers so much more than these two attractions. </p>
      <p>Adventure sports are found all over, from jungle-interior to breathtaking coastline, and Bohol’s unique culture is carefully protected by its residents. DIscover this dynamic island and explore a natural wonderland. </p>

  - title: Negros
    class: negros
    content: >
      <p class="p--lead">This vast island encompasses a mountainous interior that spills out to stunning coastline, enveloping urban centres packed with cool bars, big eats, and laid-back locals. </p>
      <p>There’s plenty on offer, yet again it remains remarkably un-touristy with most flocking to Boracay. Why complain? The dreamy beaches are nearly empty and the island is there to be explored at whim, with few thronging crowds to contend with. </p>
